### **Project Highlights:**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enterprise-Grade Network Design** üñß
- Built a **redundant hierarchical topology** with two routers and two multilayer switches, ensuring **high availability** and minimizing **downtime**.
- Established connections to **two ISPs** for **failover** and uninterrupted internet access.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Departmental Segmentation & Wireless Access** üì∂
- Designed **VLANs** for departmental segmentation, allocating unique subnets using **172.16.1.0/22**, ensuring network isolation and scalability.
- Enabled **seamless wireless connectivity** for all departments, enhancing flexibility and mobility.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Advanced Security Measures** üõ°Ô∏èüîë
- Configured **SSH** on routers and switches for **secure remote management**.
- Implemented **port-security** in the Finance & Accounts department to prevent unauthorized access, using **sticky MAC** with a violation mode of **shutdown**.
- Used **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to control traffic and ensure secure internet access.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic IP Management & Static Server Allocation** ‚öôÔ∏è
- Deployed **dedicated DHCP servers** for **dynamic IP allocation** across all devices.
- Assigned **static IPs** to server room devices for consistency and manageability.

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimized Routing** üö¶
- Configured **OSPF** as the routing protocol for efficient and scalable route advertisement.

#### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **PAT Configuration** üåê
- Set up **Port Address Translation (PAT)** for secure internet access using the router‚Äôs outbound interface IPv4 address.
